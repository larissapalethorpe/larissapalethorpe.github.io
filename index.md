## About
I am an astrophysicist studying the formation and evolution of exoplanets, with a particular focus on small planets and population-level trends. My work combines observational data and statistical techniques to understand how planetary systems assemble, evolve, and lose their atmospheres over time.

I am currently a Royal Society Career Development Fellow at the University of Bristol, where I lead independent research into small exoplanets in transitional regimes using data from missions including TESS, CHEOPS, HARPS-N, and JWST.

## Research
My research focuses on understanding the nature and evolution of small exoplanets, particularly those that lie at the boundary between rocky and volatile-rich worlds. Key themes include:

- Exoplanet demographics and population-level trends  
- The exoplanet radius valley and atmospheric loss  
- Planet composition, interiors, and evolution  
- Observational studies using TESS, CHEOPS, HARPS-N, and JWST

## Publications
I am a joint first author on the discovery and characterisation of **Gliese 12 b**, a temperate Earth-sized exoplanet, and have led several first-author studies on the composition and evolution of small planets.

**Selected publications**
- Palethorpe et al. (2024), *MNRAS* — Confronting compositional confusion through the characterisation of a sub-Neptune  
- Dholakia & Palethorpe et al. (2024), *MNRAS* — Gliese 12 b: a temperate Earth-sized planet at 12 pc

## Talks, Posters & Conferences
I regularly present my research at international conferences and workshops.

**Selected highlights**
- Keynote: *Gliese 12 b* — UK Exoplanet Meeting 2024  
- Contributed talks — UK Exoplanet Meeting, Scottish Exoplanet Meeting  
- Posters — Exoplanets V, Extreme Solar Systems V, UK Exoplanet Meetings
