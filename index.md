## About
I am an astrophysicist studying the formation and evolution of exoplanets, with a particular focus on small planets in transitional regimes and population-level trends. My work combines observational data and statistical techniques to understand how planetary systems assemble, evolve, and lose their atmospheres over time.

I am currently a Royal Society Career Development Fellow at the University of Bristol, where I lead independent research into small exoplanets in transitional regimes using data from missions including TESS, CHEOPS, HARPS-N, and JWST.

---

## Research
My research focuses on understanding the nature and evolution of small exoplanets, particularly those that lie at the boundary between rocky and volatile-rich worlds. Key themes include:

- Exoplanet demographics and population-level trends
- The exoplanet radius valley and atmospheric loss
- Planet composition, interiors, and evolution
- Observational studies using transit and radial velocity data from space- and ground-based facilities
