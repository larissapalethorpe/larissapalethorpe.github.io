## About
I am an astrophysicist studying the formation and evolution of exoplanets, with a particular focus on small planets and population-level trends. My work uses observational data and statistical methods to understand how planetary systems assemble, evolve, and lose their atmospheres over time.

I am currently a Royal Society Career Development Fellow at the University of Bristol, where I lead independent research into small exoplanets in transitional regimes, combining data from missions including TESS, CHEOPS, HARPS-N, and JWST.

## Research
My research centres on understanding what small exoplanets are made of and how they evolve. Key themes include:

- Exoplanet demographics and population-level trends  
- The exoplanet radius valley and atmospheric loss  
- Planet composition, interiors, and evolution  
- Observational studies using TESS, CHEOPS, HARPS-N, and JWST  

I am particularly interested in how planets transition between rocky and volatile-rich regimes, and what this reveals about planet formation and the frequency of potentially habitable worlds.

## Publications
I am a joint first author on the discovery and characterisation of **Gliese 12 b**, a temperate Earth-sized exoplanet, and have led several first-author studies on the composition and evolution of small planets.

- Dholakia & Palethorpe et al. (2024), *MNRAS* — Gliese 12 b: a temperate Earth-sized planet at 12 pc  
- Palethorpe et al. (in prep.) — Constraining small planet compositions for the habitable worlds era

## Teaching & Supervision
I have extensive experience teaching and supervising across undergraduate and postgraduate astrophysics and planetary science courses, including scientific programming, data analysis, astrobiology, and introductory astrophysics.

I have also supervised students in designing and delivering community-focused physics outreach projects, with a strong emphasis on science communication and public engagement.

---

## Outreach & Media
I am actively involved in public engagement and science communication. My work has featured in international media following the discovery of Gliese 12 b, including coverage by NASA, CNN, New Scientist, Sky News, and BBC Sky at Night.

I regularly give public talks, participate in panel discussions, and contribute to outreach initiatives aimed at widening participation in physics and astronomy.
